# Service Locator

Lightweight Service Locator for Unity projects with lifecycle management. Well-suited for prototypes and projects where you don't want to use a DI framework.

Lifetime Scopes:
- Singleton - one instance for the entire game
- Scoped - instance exists within a scope (scene)
- Transient - new instance on each request
